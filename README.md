# about-me


### Basic Biography

I am a random person from earth. I like math and computers, as well as reading books and using over-the-top complex stationary (writing materials).

### What I like about Information Technology

In software engineering, I like the unconventional yet practical applications of mathematics.  I enjoy learning about the famous algorithms that changed the industry as well as the math behind them. A few interesting ones are the use of modular arithmetic to ensure irreversability of an operation as used in the Bitcoin protocol or the matrix multiplication principles used in quantum-proof encryption protocols.  I also am studying linear algebra to know more about how Artificial Intelligence models work.

### My prior experience 

Previously, I have used Python to build basic file and web-scraping systems.  In regards to math, I have taken two years of calculus at my school.  I have learned C# in a programming class at school and independently studied C++, though I don't remember much of it now.

### What I would like to try

Predominantly, I would like to try anything related to mathematics, like low-level blockchain, machine learning, or other low-level information systems needing math to understand. I am interested in experimental algorithms for a variety of computer systems.

### A fun fact about myself

Despite the fact I am pursuing a degree in mathematics, I believe that the applications of math are equally important: without them math would have no point. This is why I am actively learning related fields like information technology, as an immediate way to apply even the most advanced math topics.
